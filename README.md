- Unstable Victim's Lab Features
- User Interface Problems
- IP & PORT configuration problems

<br></br>

- [x] [Client Report](https://github.com/Morsmalleo/AhMyth/issues/new?assignees=Morsmalleo&labels=bug%2C+error&template=client-report.md&title=)

Use this Issue Template if you experience any of the following issues

<br></br>

- [x] [Binding Report](https://github.com/Morsmalleo/AhMyth/issues/new?assignees=Morsmalleo&labels=bug%2C+error&template=binding-report.md&title=)

Use this Issue Template when you are greeted with any errors when using the Binding Features.

<br>

### <div align="center"><ins>Blank Issues</ins></div>
If you experience errors that arent related to any of the *Issue Templates*, or if you cant seem to fix your problem using the *Troubleshoot Manual*, then please start a *[Blank Issue](https://github.com/Morsmalleo/AhMyth/issues/new)* and post it with enough valid information about the problem.

We work hard here to keep the *Issues Section* as clean and as understanding as possible, so please help us to do that by using the *Issue Templates* or by providing non-template Issues with decent information.

Duplicate Issues will also be removed without question if I can see that the user was to lazy to check the closed issues.
